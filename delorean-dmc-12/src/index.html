            JDK 16: What’s coming in Java 16 from InfoWorld Java
          </h3>
          <p>
            Although not due to arrive until March 2021, Java Development Kit (JDK) 16 has begun to
            take shape, with proposed features including concurrent thread-stack processing for
            garbage collection, support for C++ 14 language features.
          </p>
          <p>
            JDK 16 will be the reference implementation of the version of standard Java set to
            follow JDK 15, which arrived September 15. The six-month release cadence for standard
            Java would have JDK 16 arriving next March.

            CentOS 8 released!
          </h3>
          <p>
            Today, the CentOS community released the much-awaited CentOS 8 (1905). RHEL 8 was
            released in May this year at the Red Hat Summit 2019. Users were highly anticipating
            this CentOS 8 rebuild. In CentOS 8, the community has partnered more closely with
            Fedora and will be sharing git repos with the Fedora system.

            Darklang available in private beta
          </h3>
          <p>
            Yesterday, the team behind Dark programming language has unveiled Darklang’s private
            beta version. Dark is a holistic programming language, editor, and infrastructure for
            building backends. Developers can write in the Dark language, using the Dark editor,
            and the program is hosted on Dark’s infrastructure. As a result, they can code without
            thinking about infrastructure, and have safe instant deployment, which the team is
            calling “deployless” development.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the team, backends today are too complicated to build and they have
            designed Dark in a way to reduce that complexity. Ellen Chisa, CEO of the Dark says,
            “Today we’re releasing two videos showing how Dark works. And demonstrate how to build
            a backend application (an office sign-in app) in 10 minutes.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul Biggar, the CTO also talks about the Dark’s philosophy and the details of the
            language, the editor and the infrastructure. He also shows how they make “deployless”
            safe with feature flags and versioning, and how Dark allows to introspect and debug
            live requests.

          <p>
            Python, C++, C, and MATLAB are all popular programming languages that are used in a
            wide range of applications. Each language has its own strengths and weaknesses, and
            the choice of language will depend on the specific requirements.

            Python is a high-level, interpreted language that is known for its simplicity and
            ease of use. It is often used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine
            learning. Python has a large number of libraries and modules that make it easy to

          Codota raises $12m for its code auto-complete technology
        </h3>
        <img class="image" src="../../task-img/news-img.png"

        <p class="img-description">
          From left: Codota CEO Dror Weiss and CTO Eran Yahav.
        </p>
        <div class="text-under-pic">
          <p>
            Today (27 April), Israeli start-up Codota announced that it has raised $12m in Series
            A funding from E.ventures and Khosla Ventures. New investors TPY Capital and Hetz
            Ventures also joined the round.

            Founders Dror Weiss and Eran Yahav set up the company in 2015, building the platform
            using open-source code from GitHub and Stack Overflow.

            To date, Codota has raised more than $16m in funding for its AI software for developers.
            In 2019, the company acquired competitor TabNine. Along with today’s funding, the
            start-up also announced the launch of its complete version for JavaScript, which merges
            Codota’s platform with TabNine’s technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            The start-up’s semantic AI infrastructure was created to emulate the human understanding
            of computer code and is based on more than a decade’s worth of academic research at
            Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology.

            Since Codota was founded, the company claims it has analysed millions of code
            repositories to generate insights that can boost developer productivity. Codota
            compares its technology to Gmail’s Smart Compose feature.

            The platform automates the predictable parts of the coding development cycle, such as
            looking up syntax and applying the best practices for using common libraries, by
            suggesting the next piece of code the developer may need.

            Codota’s platform supports all major coding languages, including Python, JavaScript,
            Java, C and HTML. The platform operates across popular integrated development
            environments such as VSCode, Eclipse and IntelliJ.
