          JDK 16: What’s coming in Java 16 from InfoWorld Java
        </h3>
        <p>
          Although not due to arrive until March 2021, Java Development Kit (JDK) 16 has begun to take shape, with proposed features including concurrent thread-stack processing for garbage collection, support for C++ 14 language features, and an “elastic metaspace” capability to more quickly return unused class metadata memory to the OS.
        </p>
        <p>
          JDK 16 will be the reference implementation of the version of standard Java set to follow JDK 15, which arrived September 15. The six-month release cadence for standard Java would have JDK 16 arriving next March.

          Darklang available in private beta
        </h3>
        <p>
          Yesterday, the team behind Dark programming language has unveiled Darklang’s private beta version. Dark is a holistic programming language, editor, and infrastructure for building backends. Developers can write in the Dark language, using the Dark editor, and the program is hosted on Dark’s infrastructure. As a result, they can code without thinking about infrastructure, and have safe instant deployment, which the team is calling “deployless” development.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the team, backends today are too complicated to build and they have designed Dark in a way to reduce that complexity. Ellen Chisa, CEO of the Dark says, “Today we’re releasing two videos showing how Dark works. And demonstrate how to build a backend application (an office sign-in app) in 10 minutes.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Paul Biggar, the CTO also talks about the Dark’s philosophy and the details of the language, the editor and the infrastructure. He also shows how they make “deployless” safe with feature flags and versioning, and how Dark allows to introspect and debug live requests.

          Codota raises $12m for its code auto-complete technology
        </h3>
        <img class="image" src="../../task-img/news-img.png" alt="Codota CEO Dror Weiss and CTO Eran Yahav">
        <p class="img-description">
          From left: Codota CEO Dror Weiss and CTO Eran Yahav.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today (27 April), Israeli start-up Codota announced that it has raised $12m in Series A funding from E.ventures and Khosla Ventures. New investors TPY Capital and Hetz Ventures also joined the round.

          Founders Dror Weiss and Eran Yahav set up the company in 2015, building the platform using open-source code from GitHub and Stack Overflow.

          To date, Codota has raised more than $16m in funding for its AI software for developers. In 2019, the company acquired competitor TabNine. Along with today’s funding, the start-up also announced the launch of its complete version for JavaScript, which merges Codota’s platform with TabNine’s technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The start-up’s semantic AI infrastructure was created to emulate the human understanding of computer code and is based on more than a decade’s worth of academic research at Technion, the Israel Institute of Technology.

          Since Codota was founded, the company claims it has analysed millions of code repositories to generate insights that can boost developer productivity. Codota compares its technology to Gmail’s Smart Compose feature.

          The platform automates the predictable parts of the coding development cycle, such as looking up syntax and applying the best practices for using common libraries, by suggesting the next piece of code the developer may need.

          Codota’s platform supports all major coding languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, C and HTML. The platform operates across popular integrated development environments such as VSCode, Eclipse and IntelliJ.
