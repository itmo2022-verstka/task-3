                We at Daily Paws are of the sound be&shy;lief that look&shy;ing at an&shy;im&shy;als on the in&shy;ter&shy;net
                is not only the best job ever
                (e-v-e-r), but also a huge stress re&shy;liev&shy;er. This sci&shy;entif&shy;ic study backs that last point

                re&shy;search
                states that cat memes and videos give us feel&shy;ings of hap&shy;pi&shy;ness, hope, and re&shy;newed
                en&shy;ergy, and also re&shy;duce our
                anxi&shy;ety,
                an&shy;noy&shy;ance, and sad&shy;ness. Bam! Wins all around. <br>
                So while we can't present every single one of the fun&shy;ni&shy;est cat memes of 2021, we've
                cul&shy;tiv&shy;ated a few that made
                us snort

                pho&shy;toshopped

                Ap&shy;pear&shy;ing first in late 2013 and reach&shy;ing peak pop&shy;ular&shy;ity in March 2014, this meme

                mouth-wa&shy;ter&shy;ing food pos&shy;ted on the in&shy;ter&shy;net. It fea&shy;tures a star&shy;ing fat cat

                cap&shy;tion.

                re&shy;quire, well, heavy
                breath&shy;ing.

                Oc&shy;to&shy;ber that year.
                The meme usu&shy;ally starts with a situ&shy;ation, then con&shy;tin&shy;ues to an anxious re&shy;ac&shy;tion.
                Why it’s so pop&shy;u&shy;lar is that
                though many
                of the re&shy;ac&shy;tions or feel&shy;ings are ex&shy;ag&shy;ger&shy;ated, they’re also pretty
